# Secure Development Guide

## Welcome to the Secure Development Guide!

The purpose of this guide is to discuss industry accepted secure development practices specially applied to the open source context. While there are many references and documents freely available on the internet, this guide specifically talks about secure application design and secure development processes and practices. Currently secure coding is out of scope and is covered by another similar document.
