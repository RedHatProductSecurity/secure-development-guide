# Static application security testing (SAST)

## Introduction
Also known as static analysis, this method works by running specialized software called static analyzers on the application source code. Static Analyzers use an internal model of the execution process of the application and based on in-built rules they are able to detect anomalies with the source code. Some of these issues can result in security flaws. A lot of common vulnerability classes can be detected by using static analyzers.
